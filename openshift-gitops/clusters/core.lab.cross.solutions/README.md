# TODO

- configure vault as intermediate CA
- set up SMTP monitoring for UPS(s), NAS, and other relevant systems
  - Evaluate using EDA to respond to power going out

- Use SR-IOV to have dedicated NIC for each openshift node (both lab and labstorage networks)
- Check out homepage dashboard for lab (can annotate pods in podman)
